My name is Jessica Raines and I reside in Nashville, TN. I am currently a student at Nashville Software School. About 3 months ago, I decided to change my career path and programming is the path I have chosen. I am a new mother so when I am not studying or attending class, I am chasing around an 11 month old. My life has been turned upside down and inside out, but I am enjoying the ride.
