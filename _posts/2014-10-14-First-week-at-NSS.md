My first week as a Cohort 7 student has been refreshing. I spent the last three months
flying through a MEAN stack, learning HTML, CSS, Jade, Bootstrap and touching on jQuery and Ajax.
While it may sound impressive, it was definitely overwhelming. I barely had time to eat or
even use the rest room, and sleep? I am starting to remember what that feels like. So you can imagine
my surprise when I stepped foot into Eliza Brocks class and she announces that we are required to get
8 hours of sleep and urges us to get up from our computers for 10 minutes, every hour. The class styles
are extreme opposites, and I can see the value in both of them, but this is a much better fit for
me. We are being taught how to learn; how to use uncle Google to find the answers to our questions.
That may sound obvious, but it is easier said than done. Trying to find understandable documentation
has proven to be extremely difficult. So getting instruction and guidance on how to search and find
a solution is invaluable.
