My first week as a Cohort 7 student has been refreshing. I spent the last three months flying through a MEAN stack, learning HTML, CSS, Jade, Bootstrap and touching on jQuery and Ajax. While it may sound impressive, it was definitely overwhelming. I barely had time to eat or even use the rest room, and sleep? I am starting to remember what that feels like. So you can imagine my surprise when I stepped foot into Eliza Brock's class and she announcest that we are encouraged to get 8 hours of sleep and urges us to get up from our computers for 10 minutes, every hour. The class styles are extreme opposites, and I can see the value in both of them, but this is a much better fit for me. We are being taught how to learn; how to use uncle Google to find the answers to our questions. That may sound obvious, but it is easier said than done. Trying to find understandable documentation has proven to be extremely difficult. So getting instruction and guidance on how to search and find a solution is invaluable. I am going to include some links that I found useful so I can reference them in the future.

  * This [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/ "daringfireball.net") link is really helpful for learning markdown.
  * This [You Might Not Need JQuery] (http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ "youmightnotneedjquery.com") link is great for finding alternatives to writing jQuery.
  * This [Make Your Mockup in Markup](http://24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup/ "24ways.org/2009/make-your-mockup-in-markup") link is a tool that will bring you into the 21st century for styling your product.
  * This [Zen Garden](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/ "mezzoblue.com/zengarden") site shows how one html file can be transformed over and over just by using CSS.
  * And last, but by no means least this [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "jekyllrb.com") site gives you the ins and outs of building your own blogs just like this one.
