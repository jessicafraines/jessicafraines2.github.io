I am attempting to describe the differences between MVC, MVP and MVVM. 

MVC - MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER: The model manages the data of an application. It handles the business logic. The view is a visual representation of models and present a filtered view of their current state. The controller is the intermediary between models and views which are classically responsible for updating the model when the user manipulates the view. It processes incoming reqests from the browser. The view sits on top of the architecture with the controller beside it. Views and models know about each other. The downside is that by exposing the model to the view, there may be security issues.

MVP - MODEL VIEW PRESENTER: MVP is similar to MVC, but the controller is replaced with the presenter. The presenter sits at the same level as the views. The main difference between the controller and the presenter is that the presenter doesnt manage incoming requests.

MVVM - MODEL VIEW VIEW MODEL: This pattern supports two-way binding between the view and view model. It creates sections of a model that should be exposed to a view. It provides security and performance advantages, but it is more complex because you have to translate between the View Model and the view.
