If at first you don't succeed, you might be coding! Trial and error, and error, and error. That's pretty much how my coding goes, but when it works I get so excited I can feel it down to my core. This is how I know I made the right choice on my new career path. 
This past week, we have been working with raw JavaScript. Using the [DOM](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/introduction.html)  to make amazing things happen. We worked on a few apps: [Volunteerism](https://github.com/jessicafraines/volunteerism) - an app that picks a student(s) to "volunteer" to do something. We added some JavaScript to our [Savings-Multiplied](https://github.com/jessicafraines/savings-multiplied) app and we started working on a [Weather-Forecast](https://github.com/jessicafraines/weather-forecast) app. The Weather-Forecast app started off as an app that would show the 5 day forecast for Nashville. We used the [Weather Underground API](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs) to get the information that we needed. Once that part was complete, we took it to the next level by adding the option of entering a zip code to get the weather for a specific location. Now we are on to the third part and that is adding geolocation. The documentation is rather limited on this subject, surprisingly, but I think I have a plan. Next week we will be adding graphs and charts. 
If you look at any of these apps you may notice that I haven't done much CSS yet. Don't judge, it's coming. I have been focusing on my JavaScript, but I won't let the CSS slide.
